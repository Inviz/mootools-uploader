FancyUpload has a second life!

This package contains a transparent Uploader class that uses the upload adapter most appropriate.

Supports three modes
  - Request (HTML5, multiple)
  - Swiff (Flash, multiple)
  - IFrame (simple HTML form callback)
  
Common stuff is abstracted away to base Uploader namespace and File classes are refactored so they can be mixed
in in any other widget class. They also include a common mixin so you can define some common methods.
